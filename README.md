Little Lemon 🍋

This wasn’t just another course—it was a transformative experience that pushed me to my limits, strengthened my technical expertise, and honed my resilience and problem-solving skills. From mastering modern tools to tackling complex challenges, this journey has prepared me to take on real-world projects with confidence and creativity. Ready to see how it all came together? Let’s dive in! 👇

Little Lemon 🍋—a dynamic website that transforms the user experience while capturing the essence of this family-inherited restaurant.

Initially, the website was a static single-page application featuring only a homepage. My task was to expand its functionality and design by developing additional pages: About, Reservations, and Order Online. And to make usre each page is dynamic, interactive, and crafted to elevate the user experience.
Here’s how the site flows:
🚪 Login Page:
I introduced a Login Page as the default entry point. This page includes two fields: a username and a predefined password. Users simply enter their name to access the site, creating a personalized and welcoming experience.
🏡 Homepage:
The homepage highlights Little Lemon’s story and dynamically showcases the Special Meals of the Week—bringing a fresh and engaging experience to every visit!
📖 About Page:
A detailed dive into Little Lemon’s journey, mission, and values, paired with an immersive visual tour of the restaurant.
📅 Reservation Page:
This is the powerhouse of the website, where most of the functionality comes to life. It features two key sections:
A form to collect user details for reservations.
A dynamic summary of menu items selected by users, seamlessly connecting browsing and booking.
This is, without a doubt, my favorite page!
🛒 Order Online (Menu) Page:
An interactive menu where users can select or deselect items, with real-time updates reflected in their reservation summary.

💡 Challenges I Overcame:
Self-Learning: I explored additional resources beyond the course to fully grasp complex concepts.
UI Design: Crafting a visually appealing menu page required extra research and iterations.
Reservation Page Complexity: This was the most demanding aspect—I rewrote the code multiple times to perfect both the UI and functionality.
Trial and Error with Packages: Experimented with various packages to find the best fit for specific features.
Technical Issues: Debugging and optimizing website performance took significant effort.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
React: The core framework for building the application.
Styled Components: For clean, scalable styling.
Formik & Yup: Simplifying form validation and error handling.
Context API & useReducer: Efficient state management for dynamic data.
Local Storage: For persisting user-specific information across pages.

Key Takeaways:
HTML, CSS & JavaScript​: Revamped my understanding of web fundamentals, building interactive and responsive user interfaces.
React: Mastered React to create dynamic UIs with state management (including useReducer and Context API for scalable solutions).
Git: Leveraged Git for version control, managing code, and collaborating in a team setting—especially useful in tracking changes during project development.
CSS Frameworks: Implemented Bootstrap and Chakra UI for faster, mobile-first responsive designs.
Formik & Yup: Efficiently handled form validation and error management in web apps.
